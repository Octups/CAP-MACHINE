# Exploit Title: Automated SSH and File Download Script for CTF Challenges
# Date: 05.09.2024
# Author: Octups
# Description: This Python script automates the process of downloading a .pcap file from a web server and optionally establishes an SSH connection to a remote server. 
# The script checks for a file download button on the specified URL, downloads the file to the user's desktop, and provides an option to automate SSH login using pexpect.
# Software Link: https://github.com/Octups/CAP-MACHINE.git
# Tested on: Kali Linux
